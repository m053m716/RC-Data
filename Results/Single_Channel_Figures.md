**Figure 1: Trends in main effect of Peak-Offset by Area.** Dashed lines represent random effects for individual animals. Scatter points represent individual trials, with shapes corresponding to individual animals. Full range of peaks recovered from fit are shown to illustrate heterogeneity of peak timing (gray regions are 95% confidence bounds on panel means, shown by dotted lines, for each post-op day). 

![Grouped Peak-Offset by Post-Op Day](../images/Grouped Center-Frequency by Post-Op Day.png)**Figure 2: No effect on Center Frequency (by area or treatment).** Dashed lines represent random effects for individual animals. Scatter points represent individual trials, with shapes corresponding to individual animals. Gray band is the 95% confidence bound on panel mean by post-op day. There is a slight interaction effect by treatment-group for center frequency by post-op day. Notably, for both areas, there are more outlier "high-frequency" channels in the **Ischemia** group.
